A sequence similarity network (SSN) allows for visualization of relationships among protein sequences. In SSNs, the most related proteins are grouped together in clusters. The Enzyme Similarity Tool (EFI-EST) makes it possible to easily generate SSNs. Cytoscape is used to explore SSNs.

EFI-GNT allows exploration of the genome neighborhoods for sequence similarity network (SSN) clusters in order to facilitate the assignment of function within protein families and superfamilies.
