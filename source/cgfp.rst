Conmputationally-Guided Functional Profiling (CGFP)
===================================================

Chemically guided functional profiling (CGFP) maps metagenome protein abundance to clusters in sequence similarity networks (SSNs) generated by the EFI-EST web tool.

EFI-CGFP uses the ShortBRED software package developed by Huttenhower and colleagues in two successive steps: 1) identify sequence markers that are unique to members of families in the input SSN that are identified by ShortBRED and share 85% sequence identity using the CD-HIT algorithm (CD-HIT 85 clusters) and 2) quantify the marker abundances in metagenome datasets and then map these to the SSN clusters.

Setup Environment
=================
First you need to setup the environment for the EFITools to run.  You need to source the environment.sh file from the EFITools directory

.. code-block:: bash

   source /usr/local/EFITools/environment.sh
