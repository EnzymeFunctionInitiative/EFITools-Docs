Genome Neighborhood Tool (GNT)
==============================

* GNT
The EFI-GNT (EFI Genome Neighborhood Tool) is focused on placing protein families and superfamilies into a genomic context. A sequence similarity network (SSN) is used as an input. Each sequence within a SSN is used as a query for interrogation of its genome neighborhood.  EFI-GNT enables exploration of the genome neighborhoods for sequences in SSN clusters in order to facilitate their assignment of function.
